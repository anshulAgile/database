Database

### Relational

## Data Structure

- Structured Database
- Uses SQL to fetch and manipulate data
- Relational Database has a fixed schema.

## Scalability

- Relational databases have limited scalability, making them less suitable for large datasets and high read/write loads.
- Relational database or RDBMS databases are vertically Scalable When load increase on RDBMS database then we scale database by increasing server hardware power ,need to by expensive and bigger servers
- Maintaining high-end RDBMS systems is expensive and need trained manpower for database management
- NoSQL databases require less management. it support many Features like automatic repair, easier data distribution, and simpler data models make administration and tuning requirements lesser in NoSQL

## Use Cases

- Good for Predictable data
- Relational Database is used to handle data coming in low velocity.
- NoSQL databases are used to handle moderate volume of data.
- Relational database gives read scalability only.
- Relation database is deployed in vertical fashion.

=================================================================================================================

### Non Relational

## Data Structure

- Does not uses traditional SQL syntax instead uses various data models like
   - key-value
   - document
   - column-family ( Column family databases store data in columns )
   - graph
   

- Uses SQL to fetch and manipulate data
- Good for Predictable data
- NoSQL Database has no fixed schema.

## Scalability

- Non-relational databases are highly scalable and can handle large-scale, distributed data more efficiently.
- NoSQL databases are designed to expand horizontally and in Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources.

## Use Cases

- Good when data is not Predictable
- NoSQL Database is used to handle data coming in high velocity.
- NoSQL databases can handle big data or data in a very high volume .
- NoSQL database gives both read and write scalability.
- NoSQL database is deployed in horizontal fashion.
